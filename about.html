        <h2>Entry 1 - Understanding Existence</h2>

        <p>It is undoubtedly a very difficult task to understand the nature of existence, or how to even define the term.
            In the age of technology, can the standard of which we say “this exists” be extended to ideas or information?
           I would certainly argue that we can state that something exists even while it is in its simplest form. 
           Consider a human being, which is ultimately made up of cells and genetic code, which contain vital information. 
           While this information is transcribed upon the cells, this information could also be considered to exist regardless of whether or not it is being utilized by a cell. 
           I would ask you to also consider an idea: if NASA were to launch a newspaper into outer space (and nobody were to read it or even know its contents), would this newspaper (and its ideas) still be deemed to exist?
            Perhaps not by human society, but by the universe as a whole.
            Every single atom, quark, and any energy of any type is information that the universe contains within itself, regardless of whether or not that information is utilized by human beings or not. 
           Ultimately, the idea of whether something exists or not comes down to what standards an individual classifies something as existing.
